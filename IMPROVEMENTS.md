# üöë Ambulance Driver App - Improvements & Fixes

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **GPS Location Fetching** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: App was using dummy location instead of real GPS
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced GPS service to properly request permissions
  - Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implemented real GPS tracking with mock data fallback for demo purposes
  - Changed fallback location to Mumbai, India (more relevant than San Francisco)

### 2. **Map Visibility Issues** ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Map was not visible and failing to load
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed Google Maps API integration
